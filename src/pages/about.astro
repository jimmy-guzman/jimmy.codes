      <p>
        I’m Jimmy Guzman Moreno, an engineering leader with 9+ years of
        experience in frontend, backend, and distributed systems. I have a
        passion for the craft of creating software, blending hands-on coding
        with technical strategy. I focus on mentorship, developer experience,
        and building architecture that lasts.

        </li>
        <li>
          Built an Nx monorepo that enabled independent deployments for multiple

      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>
        I’m currently a Lead Engineer at Target, where I design scalable supply
        chain services and improve developer workflows. Before that, I was a
        Senior Lead Engineer at Ameriprise, leading the guest access platform,
        building an enterprise React component library, and implementing Nx
        pipelines that only deploy affected projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        My path into engineering wasn’t traditional. I started in a call center,
        studied during breaks using Team Treehouse, freeCodeCamp, and Watch and
        Code, and worked through
        <em>Clean Code</em> and <em>You Don’t Know JS Yet</em>. After months of
        self-learning, I became a teaching assistant at a coding bootcamp, which
        led to my first engineering role.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve specialized in high-performance systems, scalable
        architecture, and developer experience. I’ve found that my best work
        comes from helping teams ship faster and with confidence through clear
        strategy and strong technical foundations.
