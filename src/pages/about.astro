      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a <strong>Lead Engineer at Target</strong>, where I
        architect scalable <strong>supply chain</strong> solutions and improve developer
        workflows. Before that, I was a <strong
          >Senior Lead Engineer at Ameriprise</strong
        >, where I <strong>led the guest access platform</strong>, <strong
          >built an enterprise React component library</strong
        >, and <strong
          >led the adoption of NX and designed the pipeline to only deploy
          affected NX projects</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        But my path to engineering leadership wasn't traditional. Several years
        ago, I was working at a <strong>call center</strong> when I decided to transition
        into software engineering. During my breaks and after work, I studied at
        <strong>Team Treehouse, freeCodeCamp, and Watch and Code</strong>, while
        reading <strong>Clean Code</strong> and <strong
          >You Don't Know JS Yet</strong
        >. After months of self-learning, I landed my first role as a <strong
          >Teaching Assistant at a coding bootcamp</strong
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        From there, I worked my way up through various engineering roles,
        eventually specializing in <strong
          >high-performance systems, scalable architecture, and developer
          experience</strong
        >. Along the way, I discovered my passion for <strong
          >mentorship, technical strategy, and driving business impact through
          architecture</strong
        > - which led me to where I am today, leading engineering teams and developing
        talent, with multiple engineers I've worked with achieving promotions to
        <strong>Senior Engineer</strong> and <strong>Lead Engineer</strong> roles.
