        I’m Jimmy Guzman Moreno, an engineering leader with 9+ years of
        experience in frontend, backend, and distributed systems. I have a
        passion for the craft of creating software, blending hands-on coding
        with technical strategy. I focus on mentorship, developer experience,
        and building architecture that lasts.
      </p>

      <h2>Engineering wins</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Designed a Key Activation Service that sped up a mainframe
          decommission by 6 months and reduced operational costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built an Nx monorepo that enabled independent deployments for multiple
          apps across 15+ teams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Led a migration from AngularJS to React, modernizing the frontend for
          scalability and maintainability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created a Next.js proof of concept with App Router support, enabling
          our internal design system library.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mentored engineers who went on to earn promotions to Senior Engineer
          and Lead Engineer roles.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>
        I’m currently a Lead Engineer at Target, where I design scalable supply
        chain services and improve developer workflows. Before that, I was a
        Senior Lead Engineer at Ameriprise, leading the guest access platform,
        building an enterprise React component library, and implementing Nx
        pipelines that only deploy affected projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        My path into engineering wasn’t traditional. I started in a call center,
        studied during breaks using <a

          class="link-hover"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Treehouse</a
        >, <a
          href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"
          class="link-hover"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">freeCodeCamp</a
        >, and <a
          href="https://watchandcode.com"
          class="link-hover"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch and Code</a
        >, and worked through <em>Clean Code</em> and <em
          >You Don’t Know JS Yet</em
        >. After months of self-learning, I became a teaching assistant at a
        coding bootcamp, which led to my first engineering role.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve specialized in high-performance systems, scalable
        architecture, and developer experience. I’ve found that my best work
        comes from helping teams ship faster and with confidence through clear
        strategy and strong technical foundations.
