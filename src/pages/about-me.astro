      <h2>Career Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently a <strong>Lead Engineer at Target</strong>, where I
        architect scalable
        <strong>supply chain</strong> solutions and improve developer workflows.
        Before that, I was a <strong>Senior Lead Engineer at Ameriprise</strong
        >, where I <strong>led the guest experience platform</strong> and <strong
          >built an enterprise React component library</strong
        >. Early in my career, I worked as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong>
        for a coding bootcamp and as a <strong>freelance web developer</strong>,
        helping businesses optimize their web presence.
      </p>

      <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
      <p>
        Several years ago, I was working at a <strong>call center</strong> when I
        decided to transition into software engineering. During my breaks and after
        work, I studied at <strong
          >Team Treehouse, freeCodeCamp, and Watch and Code</strong
        >, while reading <strong>Clean Code</strong> and <strong
          >You Don't Know JS Yet</strong
        >. After months of self-learning, I landed my first role as a <strong
          >Teaching Assistant at a coding bootcamp</strong
        >, and from there, I worked my way into engineering leadership.
