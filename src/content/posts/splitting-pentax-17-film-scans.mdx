I recently got into photography but I didn't make it easy on myself. I picked up the **Pentax 17**, a half-frame film camera that captures two 17x24 mm photos on a single 35 mm frame.

Each scan from the lab comes back as a single image with both frames side by side, separated by a dark divider. Cropping them manually gets tedious fast: crop, save, repeat. After a few rolls, it's easy to make mistakes.

I wanted a faster and more reliable process, or I'm just lazy, so I built an automated solution using [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) and [**Sharp**](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com). It splits each scan into two clean frames and optimizes their dimensions to preserve quality. Along the way, I learned more than expected about how images are processed, measured, and compressed.

Here's how it works.

---

## The Problem

My local lab returns each film scan as a single JPEG. Each contains the following:

- Two frames separated by a dark vertical divider
- Divider widths that vary (usually 10-110 px, sometimes 300-900 px)
- Slightly inconsistent frame dimensions
- A need for consistent, high-quality output

![Example of a raw Pentax 17 scan showing two frames side by side with a dark divider in the middle](@/assets/images/before-photo.jpg)

The challenge was to detect the divider, extract both frames, and export them at uniform dimensions without unnecessary cropping or letterboxing.

> [!NOTE]
> _Letterboxing_ adds black bars to fit a specific aspect ratio. It preserves the full image but wastes pixels and reduces effective resolution.

---

## The Approach

I designed the workflow as a **two-pass pipeline**:

1. Scan all images to determine the optimal output dimensions based on actual frame aspect ratios.
2. Extract and resize frames using the target size calculated in the first pass.

This approach adapts dynamically to small scan variations instead of relying on fixed coordinates.

---

## Image Processing Pipeline

### 1. Grayscale Conversion for Divider Detection

The first step is simplifying the image. Each scan is converted to grayscale, and the raw pixel data is extracted:

```ts
const grayBuffer = await image.clone().grayscale().raw().toBuffer();
```

**Why grayscale?**

- Simplifies to a single intensity channel
- Dividers are always dark regardless of color
- Removes noise from color channel variations

Sharp's `.grayscale()` uses the luminance-preserving ITU-R BT.709 formula:

```log
Y = 0.2126 R + 0.7152 G + 0.0722 B
```

This matches how humans perceive brightness and gives more accurate divider detection.

The `.raw()` method returns an uncompressed `Uint8Array`:

- One byte per pixel (0-255)
- Row-major order: `[row0col0, row0col1, …]`
- Direct pixel access with no decoding overhead

---

### 2. Column Intensity Analysis

To find the divider, I average brightness across each vertical column:

```ts
const columnIntensity = Array.from({ length: width }, (_, x) => {
  let sum = 0;

  for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    const pixel = grayBuffer[y * width + x];

    if (pixel) sum += pixel;
  }

  return sum / height;
});
```

`y * width + x` converts 2D coordinates to a 1D index.

**Why vertical averaging?**

- The divider runs top to bottom
- Averaging removes horizontal noise
- Produces a clean intensity profile: high (frame) → low (divider) → high (frame)

---

### 3. Smoothing with a Moving Average

Film grain and scanning artifacts introduce noise. A moving average helps smooth it out:

```ts
const smooth = (array: number[], windowSize: number) => {
  const half = Math.floor(windowSize / 2);

  return array.map((_, i) => {
    const start = Math.max(0, i - half);
    const end = Math.min(array.length, i + half + 1);
    const slice = array.slice(start, end);

    return slice.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / slice.length;
  });
};

const smoothed = smooth(columnIntensity, 15);
```

**15-pixel Window size:**
Large enough to filter single-pixel noise but small enough to preserve edges.

The result is a stable brightness curve where the divider appears as a clear valley.

---

### 4. Divider Boundary Detection

Once smoothed, the divider valley and boundaries can be detected:

```ts
const minValue = Math.min(...smoothed);
const threshold = minValue * 1.25;
const minX = smoothed.indexOf(minValue);

let start = minX;
while (start > 0 && smoothed[start] < threshold) start--;

let end = minX;
while (end < smoothed.length && smoothed[end] < threshold) end++;

let dividerStart = Math.max(0, start - 2);
let dividerEnd = Math.min(width, end + 2);
```

**Threshold (1.25x):**
Edges of the divider are often brighter than the center. The 25% tolerance ensures the full divider is captured.

**2-pixel margin:**
Prevents losing edge pixels during cropping.

If the detected divider collapses to a single column, a minimum width is enforced:

```ts
if (dividerEnd - dividerStart < 10) {
  const center = minX;
  const half = 5;

  dividerStart = Math.max(0, center - half);
  dividerEnd = Math.min(width, center + half);
}
```

---

### 5. Crop Region Calculation

With divider boundaries defined, both frames can be cropped:

```ts
const leftCropWidth = Math.min(
  dividerStart - cropPadding,
  width - dividerEnd - cropPadding,
);

const bleed = 6;
const leftCropStart = Math.max(0, dividerStart - leftCropWidth - bleed);
const rightCropStart = Math.min(width, dividerEnd + bleed);
```

**Why use the narrower side?**

- Guarantees symmetrical results
- Compensates for uneven spacing on film

The **6-pixel bleed** slightly overlaps the divider to prevent losing frame edges. It's safer to include a few dark pixels than to crop too tightly.

Aspect ratios are stored for later optimization:

```ts
aspectRatio: cropWidth / cropHeight;
```

---

### 6. Two-Pass Optimization

After analyzing all scans, I calculate the best target size:

```ts
const allAspectRatios = analysisResults.flatMap((r) => [
  r.leftCrop.aspectRatio,
  r.rightCrop.aspectRatio,
]);

const medianAspectRatio = median(allAspectRatios);

const targetSize = {
  width: 900,
  height: Math.round(900 / medianAspectRatio),
};
```

**Why median?**

- Less affected by outliers
- Represents the "typical" frame ratio

In practice, this produced 900x1300 px outputs: sharp, consistent, and balanced.

To verify:

```ts
const tolerance = 0.05;
const perfect = ratios.filter(
  (ratio) => Math.abs(ratio / targetAspectRatio - 1) <= tolerance,
).length;
```

Results:

- **89%** of frames fit perfectly
- **5%** cropped slightly
- **6%** had small bars

---

### 7. Extraction and Resizing

In the second pass, each frame is extracted and resized:

```ts
await image
  .clone()
  .extract(leftCrop)
  .withMetadata()
  .resize(targetSize.width, targetSize.height, {
    fit: "cover",
    position: "attention",
    kernel: sharp.kernel.lanczos3,
  })
  .jpeg({
    quality: 100,
    progressive: true,
    chromaSubsampling: "4:4:4",
  })
  .toFile(outputPath);
```

#### Key details

- `fit: "cover"` fills the target size with minimal cropping
- `position: "attention"` uses Sharp's saliency detection to preserve key features
- `kernel: lanczos3` provides high-quality resampling with less aliasing

---

### 8. JPEG Re-encoding

Because the lab delivered these scans as JPEGs, preserving quality during re-encoding is important to minimize additional generation loss:

```ts
.jpeg({
  quality: 100,
  progressive: true,
  chromaSubsampling: "4:4:4",
});
```

- **Quality 100:** near-lossless
- **Progressive:** improves perceived loading speed
- **4:4:4 chroma:** preserves full color data, critical for film scans

---

### 9. Parallel Processing

Both frames are processed concurrently:

```ts
await Promise.all([processLeftFrame(), processRightFrame()]);
```

This doubles throughput by overlapping CPU and disk operations.

---

## Results

Processing 112 images (224 frames) produced the following results:

- **3 skipped** due to invalid dimensions
- **Optimal size:** 900x1300 px
- **89% perfect fit**, **11% minimal crop or bars**
- **Divider width:** 10-110 px typical, 300-900 px outliers

## Edge Cases

**Very narrow dividers (10-16 px):**
Frames nearly touch, but the minimum-width safeguard prevents collapse.

**Very wide dividers (300-900 px):**
Usually double exposures or scanning errors. Detected correctly and flagged for review.

**Invalid dimensions:**
Zero or negative crop sizes are skipped automatically.

---

## Conclusion

What started as a time-saver turned into a compact image-processing system that combines:

- Signal analysis for accurate divider detection
- Geometric optimization for consistent aspect ratios
- High-quality resampling and color preservation
- Robust handling of edge cases

The two-pass approach (analyze, then process) delivers consistent results while maintaining the highest possible quality. In the end, 89% of frames matched perfectly, and the rest required only minor adjustment.

If you shoot half-frame film, this pipeline can save hours of manual cropping and produce cleaner, more consistent results than manual workflows.
