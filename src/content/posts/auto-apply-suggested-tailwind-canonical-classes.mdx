If you're using Tailwind CSS with VS Code, you've probably seen these suggestions from the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss):

![Tailwind IntelliSense suggesting canonical class syntax](/images/posts/tailwind-suggestion.png)

The extension helpfully suggests converting your arbitrary selectors to more canonical syntax. For example:

```diff
- className="[&>[role=checkbox]]:translate-y-[2px]"
+ className="*:[[role=checkbox]]:translate-y-0.5"
```

This is great for learning Tailwind's modern syntax, but manually updating these across an entire codebase? That's tedious work and I'm lazy.

## What is the Tailwind Upgrade CLI?

Tailwind CSS has an [official upgrade tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tailwindcss/upgrade) that automates this process:

```bash
pnpx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

This command will:

- Scan your entire project for Tailwind classes
- Convert deprecated syntax to modern equivalents
- Update to canonical class forms
- Safely transform your codebase

It does other stuff too like [upgrading between Tailwind versions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-the-upgrade-tool), but we're benefiting from the canonical class conversion here.

## How does it work?

Here's what it looks like in action. Before running the upgrade:

```tsx
<div className="[&>[role=checkbox]]:translate-y-[2px]">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

After running `pnpx @tailwindcss/upgrade`:

```tsx
<div className="*:[[role=checkbox]]:translate-y-0.5">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

As you can see some transformations were applied:

- The `*:` universal selector variant is cleaner and more idiomatic in modern Tailwind CSS.
- The `0.5` value is the canonical way to express `2px` in Tailwind's spacing scale.

The CLI analyzes your entire project and applies these transformations automatically.

## Why use canonical syntax?

Using canonical syntax isn't just about following conventions:

- **Improves readability** - Standard patterns are easier for your team to understand and maintain.
- **Better IntelliSense** - More reliable autocomplete and suggestions in your editor.
- **Aligns with docs** - Your code matches official Tailwind documentation examples, making it easier to reference.
- **Future-proofs** - Canonical syntax is less likely to need updates in future Tailwind versions.

## When to run it

I recommend running the upgrade CLI:

- After upgrading Tailwind versions
- When onboarding to a new project with older Tailwind code
- Before major refactoring work
- Periodically to keep your codebase modern
- After using a code generator that outputs Tailwind classes like [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) or similar
- After our robot friends generate code for us (like GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT etc)

## Works with all major package managers

```bash
# pnpm
pnpx @tailwindcss/upgrade
# bun
bunx @tailwindcss/upgrade
# npm
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
# yarn
yarn dlx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

## Bonus: Pair with Prettier or other formatters

For the ultimate Tailwind class management, combine this with the [official Prettier plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss):

```bash
pnpm add -D prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
```

Or with Biome's [use sorted classes rule](https://biomejs.dev/linter/rules/use-sorted-classes/)

```json title="biome.json"
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "nursery": {
        "useSortedClasses": "error"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives you automatic class sorting (Prettier plugin or Biome) and canonical syntax updates (upgrade CLI).

Together, they keep your Tailwind code clean and modern with minimal effort.

## Wrapping up

The `@tailwindcss/upgrade` CLI is one of those tools I wish I'd known about sooner. It turns a tedious manual process into a single command.

Next time VS Code suggests a canonical class format, remember: you don't have to update them one by one. Let the upgrade CLI handle it for you.
