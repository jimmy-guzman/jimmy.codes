I was recently looking at a CLI I wrote that prints file paths directly to the terminal. As those paths got longer and more numerous, I realized this creates cluttered output and forces users to copy-paste manually.

Turns out there's a simple solution: you can make terminal output clickable like HTML links using a special ANSI escape sequence called [**OSC 8**](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda).

## Why This Matters

There's a few drawbacks to printing raw URLs or file paths like this:

```log
View logs at: https://example.com/logs/123456
View file at: file:///Users/jimmy/logs/app.log
```

They do the job, but:

- Long URLs clutter your output.
- Some terminals don’t automatically make them clickable.
- Users need to copy and paste manually.

Luckily, there's a better way.

## The Solution: OSC 8 Hyperlinks

Here’s a minimal helper function:

```ts
export const link = (text: string, target: string) => {
  return `\u001B]8;;${target}\u001B\\${text}\u001B]8;;\u001B\\`;
};

console.log(link("View Logs", "https://example.com/logs/123"));
console.log(link("Open File", "file:///Users/jimmy/logs/app.log"));
```

If your terminal supports OSC 8:

- `"View Logs"` becomes clickable and opens in your browser.
- `"Open File"` opens in your default app or editor.

If not supported, it just shows plain text.

## How it works

The escape sequence breaks down as:

- `\u001B]8;;` - Start hyperlink
- `${target}` - The URL/path to link to
- `\u001B\\` - End URL, start display text
- `${text}` - What users see
- `\u001B]8;;\u001B\\` - End hyperlink

## Compatibility

Most modern terminals support this:

- iTerm2, Ghostty, Kitty
- VS Code Terminal
- GNOME Terminal (and other VTE-based terminals)
- Windows Terminal

**Tip:**

- Use `CMD+Click` on macOS.
- Use `CTRL+Click` on Linux and Windows.

## Final Thoughts

This is a tiny addition that **dramatically improves developer experience** in your CLI:

- Users no longer copy and paste URLs.
- File paths open directly with one click.
- Fallback is just plain text when unsupported.

For a single line of code, it's worth adding.
