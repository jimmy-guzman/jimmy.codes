> Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. — Richard Sennett

Remember your first hello world.  
Your first commit.  
Your first pull request.

Nobody was watching.  
Nobody was measuring.

You did it because making something work felt good.

That feeling has a name.

It's called love. ❤️

⸻

Before factories, blacksmiths made blades.

Not just sharp.  
Balanced.  
Repairable.  
Built to outlive the person who forged them.

Then machines learned to stamp metal.  
Faster.  
Cheaper.  
At scale.

The blades still cut.

They just didn't last.  
Didn't balance right.  
Couldn't be repaired, only replaced.

Most people didn't need a blade that would outlive them.  
They needed something good enough, right now.

So the craft moved.

Out to the edges.  
The specialty shops.  
The restoration studios.

For the few who still noticed the difference.

⸻

Calculators didn't kill mathematics.

They killed arithmetic as a chore.  
The tables.  
The long division.  
The tedium.

The calculator absorbed the labor.

You kept the responsibility.

You still had to understand the problem.  
Still had to know what you were solving for.

Anyone who trusted the calculator without understanding was still wrong.

Just faster.

⸻

The new tools are different.

They don't assist.  
They complete.

You ask for code, you get code.  
Functions.  
Tests.  
Documentation.

All of it plausible.  
Most of it correct.  
Some of it even good.

And it's easy to stop there.

To ship the first thing that works.  
To skip the rewrite.  
To never ask if it's right, only if it's done.

The tool can't tell the difference between code that works  
and code that deserves to exist.

You can.

If you remember that you can.

⸻

Use the tools.  
Ship faster.  
Automate the boring parts.

Just don't automate the love.  
Don't surrender the care.

Don't forget what it felt like.

The love of the craft built everything worth inheriting.

Don't forget it.
