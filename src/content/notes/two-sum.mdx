## Prompt

Given an array of integers and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume exactly one solution exists.

## Key Ideas

- Use a hash map for **O(1)** complement lookups.
- Establish complement as number needed to reach target.
- Alternative: brute-force search with nested loops.

---

## Tests

- `[2, 7, 11, 15], 9` → `[0, 1]`
- `[-3, 4, 3, 90], 0` → `[0, 2]`
- `[3, 2, 4], 6` → `[1, 2]`
- `[1, 2, 3], 7` → `[-1, -1]` (no match)

---

## Hash Map — O(n) time, O(n) space

_Mental model:_ Keep a running map of numbers we’ve seen; check if the needed complement is already in it.

```ts
function twoSum(integers: number[], target: number) {
  const seen = new Map<number, number>();

  for (let i = 0; i < integers.length; i++) {
    const current = integers[i];
    const complement = target - current;

    if (seen.has(complement)) {
      return [seen.get(complement)!, i] as const;
    }

    seen.set(current, i);
  }

  return [-1, -1] as const;
}
```

---

## For-of Loop — O(n²) time, O(1) space

_Mental model:_ For each element, search the remainder of the array for its complement.

```ts
function twoSum(integers: number[], target: number) {
  for (const [i, current] of integers.entries()) {
    const complement = target - current;

    if (integers.includes(complement, i + 1)) {
      return [i, integers.indexOf(complement, i + 1)] as const;
    }
  }

  return [-1, -1] as const;
}
```

## Variants

- **Return values instead of indices**: e.g., `[2, 7]` instead of `[0, 1]`.
- **Return all pairs**: find every unique pair that sums to target (store in a set to avoid duplicates).
- **Two Sum II (sorted input)**: use two-pointer technique for O(n) time and O(1) space.
- **3-Sum / k-Sum**: generalization; usually sort + two-pointers or recursion.
- **Two Sum with streaming data**: handle numbers as they arrive, keep a hash set of complements.
- **Two Sum closest to target**: variation where you find the pair with the smallest difference from the target.

## Takeaways

- **Map** → best for speed and scale.
- **Brute force** → acceptable for tiny inputs.
